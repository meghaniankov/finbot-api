# FINBOT - API

This repo contains the API for a chatbot, Ubb, that trains an Natural Language Processing (NLP) model and teaches about personal finance. Built as a group for the final project at Makers Academy. You can access the frontend of the project here.

The project came about as a result of wanting to built a tool

## Learning Journey

This was the team's first experience with Python, Django, Natural Language Processing, Tensorflow, and NLTK. It was also the team's first time 

## Bot/A.I. Model

The bot logic was built using [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/), a Python library for NLP, which we used to [tokenize](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/tokenization-1.html) and [stem](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/stemming-and-lemmatization-1.html) a set of intents. We trained the bot by passing that pre-proccessed-data through a neural net using Tensorflow/[TFLearn](http://tflearn.org/).

We could then predict the correct intent based on a user input. The user input would be tokenized/stemmed (i.e. create a 'bag of words') and then the model would return the intent that most closely matched the input.

Finally, the bot returned a response related to that intent.
